# OptimClass
A few resources for my optimization classes

- 'notebook' was designed for international aerospace MS students
- 'lecture notes' was designed for the same students, mostly translating and synthetizing my previous lecture notes in French.
- 'memento' was designed for French last year engineering students.

More to come, once I clean up my archives.
