    "1. Aircraft design:<br>\n",
    "We want to find the best beam shape and $L$ is fixed because it depends on the wing's geometry, so (based on the drawing provided by the design department) our variables are $x=(e,h,b)$.<br>\n",
    "What the design department wants, is to find the lightest possible beam. So they want to minimize the beam mass. Apparently, they didn't talk about changing the steel alloy they're using (only the beam shape), so we will assume a constant density $\\rho$. Therefore, the problem turns out to be the minimization problem:\n",

    "Note that $\\rho$ and $L$ are fixed (provided by the engineering department).<br>\n",

    "2. Maps reconstruction:<br>\n",
    "Drawing a map consists in finding the cities' coordinates. Let's call $(x_c,y_c)$ the coordinates of city $c$ and let's call $[1,C]$ the integer interval of city indices. The vector of decision variables is then $x = (x_0,y_0, \\ldots, x_C,y_C)$.<br>\n",
    "We want to draw a map that respects the inter-city distances. We shall write $d_{ij}$ the distance between cities $i$ and $j$ ($(i,j)\\in [1,C]^2$).<br>\n",
    "So for each pair $(i,j)$, we want the two points $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ to be $d_{ij}$ apart.<br>\n",
    "The distance between these two points is $d(i,j) = \\sqrt{\\left(x_i-x_j\\right)^2 + \\left(y_i-y_j\\right)^2}$. So we want the difference $d(i,j) - d_{ij}$ to be as close to zero as possible. We can get rid of this ugly square root and write that it is equivalent to making the difference $d(i,j)^2 - d_{ij}^2$ as close to zero as possible. Consequently, we want to minimize the  quantity $\\left(d(i,j)^2 - d_{ij}^2\\right)^2$ and we want to minimize it for all pairs of cities. So our objective function is:\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^C \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^C \\left(\\left(x_i-x_j\\right)^2 + \\left(y_i-y_j\\right)^2 - d_{ij}^2\\right)^2$$\n",
    "It is interesting to note that in the sum above, the same term appears twice: for the pairs $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$. We can simplify our objective function by writing:\n",

    "Often, when writing the decision variables and the objective function, we realize they are not sufficient to model our problem. For instance, in the aircraft design problem, we have an obvious, easy to manufacture, beam that minimizes $\\left( 2eb+eh \\right)$: if we take $e=0$ - that is zero thickness - then the volume is minimized, but it is not certain that was an acceptable beam for the design department. Was is missing is some restriction on the set of beams we look for.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular example, the reason this zero-thickness beam is not acceptable is that it won't resist the in-flight buckling loads. When we ask the design department how we can express such resistance requirements, they answer that the load that can be handled by the beam can be written $\\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$ where $I$ is the beam's moment of inertia $I = e\\frac{h^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{h}{6}+b\\right)$. Additionnaly, their previous calculations provide a value $P_{max}$ for the worst-case load suffered in flight. Consequently, we need our beam to respect:\n",
    "$$P_{max}\\leq \\frac{\\pi^2 E}{L^2} e\\frac{h^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{h}{6}+b\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a relation is what we call a **constraint**. A constraint is an equality or an inequality involving the decision variables, that reduces the set of acceptable solutions for our optimization problem. Suppose the design department also tell us they cannot manufacture beams with a thickness smaller than $e_{min}$ and they need to have a beam's tail $b$ that is always equal to $10e$. Then globally, our design problem can be modeled as:\n",
    "$$\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\n",

In other words, there is no direction that would decrease the function $f$ while letting us remain in the admissible domain.<br>\n",

The key property that we have highlighted here is that at the minimum *under constraints*, $\\nabla_x f(x)$ is collinear to $\\nabla_x h(x)$ and points in the opposite direction. Consequently, finding the minimum under constraints results in finding a point $x$ such that:\n",

    "The linear combination $\\mathcal{L}$ of $f$ and $h$ is called the **Lagrangian** of the optimization problem.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "So now you can generalize to several inequality constraints $h_1$, $h_2$, etc. The same reasoning holds also for equality constraints. And in the end, here is what you should remember (in plain English):<br>\n",

    "> An aircraft design engineer comes to you and asks:\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the design department, we usually draw plans of the plane's wings and then try out different I-beam shape factors to test if they can resist the buckling loads suffered in-flight. But we're never really sure that we have the lightest possible beam and that is a problem since the lighter our beams are, the better our plane's propulsion performance. We've heard you mathematicians can help us find the best I-beam shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The global load that can be handled by the beam can be written $\\frac{\\pi^2 E I}{L^2}$ where $I$ is the beam's moment of inertia $I = e\\frac{h^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{h}{6}+b\\right)$. Additionnaly, our previous calculations provide a value $P_{max}$ for the worst-case load suffered in flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We cannot manufacture beams with a thickness smaller than $e_{min}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a local buckling limit also that can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\\frac{P_{max}}{S} \\leq K \\left(\\frac{e}{h}\\right)^2$$\n",
    "> Where $S$ is the section's surface, and $K$ a given constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are the constants:<br>\n",
    "> $L = 503$ mm (beam's length)<br>\n",
    "> $e_{min} = 1$ mm (minimum thickness)<br>\n",
    "> $E = 75000$ MPa (Young's modulus)<br>\n",
    "> $K = \\frac{4\\pi^2 E}{12(1-\\nu^2)}$ (local buckling)<br>\n",
    "> $\\nu = 0.33$ (Poisson's coefficient)<br>\n",
    "> $P_{max} = 5\\cdot10^5$ MPa (max load)<br>\n",
